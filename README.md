# Machine Learning Algorithms for Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project is about applying different machine learning algorithms to detect credit card fraud using a publicly available dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is "Credit Card Fraud Detection" from Kaggle. It contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a period of two days in September 2013. There are 284,807 transactions in the dataset, out of which 492 are fraudulent.

# Algorithms
Three different machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset to predict fraudulent transactions:

1.Logistic Regression Algorithm
2.SVM Algorithm
3.DNN Algorithm
# Implementation
The code is written in Python using Jupyter Notebook. Libraries used in the code include pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, tensorflow, and numpy.

# Logistic Regression Algorithm
The logistic regression algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification problems. The code reads the dataset, splits it into training and testing datasets, and applies the logistic regression algorithm to predict fraudulent transactions. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

# SVM Algorithm
SVM (Support Vector Machines) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression analysis. The code applies SVM to the same training and testing datasets and evaluates the performance using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

# DNN Algorithm
Deep Neural Network (DNN) is a type of artificial neural network with multiple hidden layers. The code implements a DNN model with four layers (512, 256, 128, and 2) and trains it on the dataset. The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy score.

# Conclusion
All three algorithms performed well in detecting fraudulent transactions, with DNN having the highest accuracy score. The results suggest that machine learning algorithms can be an effective tool for detecting credit card fraud.
